					<h1>Ramie Shreim</h1>

					<h2>About Me <img class="section_icons" src="images/person_icon.png"></h2>

					<p> Hello! My name is Ramie and I'm a UX designer and a graduate from UCI's Claire Trevor School of the
						Arts. Ever since I was a child I loved to make things. Art, Games, you name it. If it
						exists, I've probably at least tried it. So it's only natural that I'd study art,
						however I found that studying art at UCI wasn't enough for me so I decided to continue my
						education and earn a UX design certification. My dream is to work with talented and creative people
						wherever that may be, and work together to make awesome things. I believe that through my
						experience working on various teams, at school and at work, I've become a reliable teammate
						that can wear many hats and communicate effectively to deliver a good final product. And if
						there is something I don't understand, I do not hesitate to ask questions and I always adapt
						and learn. I've been called a "jack of all trades" a few times before, and I find that in UX
						design this is a very good quality to have. UX designers Do many things and communicate
						with people of all kinds of roles. </p>

					<h2>As a UX Designer<img class="section_icons" src="images/wireframe.png"></h2>

					<p> As a UX designer I am capable of creating high quality UX deliverables. I can conduct and synthesize user research, create wireframes, clickable 
						prototypes, conduct and synthesize usability tests, and code in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I can also communicate effectively with designers, engineers, and stakeholders
						to deliver a product that satisfies the needs of the company and its consumers. I believe that it is a UX designers job to be the ultimate swiss army knife. A person who
						is ready to meet expectations at the office, in presentations, and especially with users. While much of my experience has to do with web and mobile, I believe that my design
						skills can translate to all sorts of media and I am 100% up to the challenge of designing for anything.  <br> <br>

						 To see some of my work, you can click on the first link below to see how me and a team of other talented UX designers created a redesign
						of the Wildlife Conservation Society's website. You can also take a look at two Invision prototypes that I did for other case studies: </p> <br> <br>

						<a href="https://invis.io/4NTSQ082EPQ#/382614521_Demo1_-desktop-" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="blank">NSA Website Redesign Concept.</a> <br> <br>
						<a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/R2T6RFCY4ZG#/screens/376099061_Notification_Screen" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="blank">"Pill Pal" Pill Taking App Concept.</a> <br> <br>
						<a href="https://invis.io/XUSVNF48RZ2#/373009286_Sign_Up_Or_Login" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="blank">"Vac Planner" Vacation Planning App Concept. (Lo-fi prototype)</a>  <br><br>  
						
						<p>And by the way, this website which you are currently viewing, was created by me entirely from scratch using HTML and CSS without any Bootstrap components. </p>

					<h2>As An Artist <img class="section_icons" src="images/paintbrush_icon.png"></h2>

					<p> As stated before, for as long as I can remember I've always liked to make things. Throughout my life I've struggled on and off
						to make better drawings, and in more recent years, make better games. Currently in my off time I'm doing figure-drawing studies and I'm working on my first ever Steam-released game titled "Axe Girl" 
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm2yGIBNqks" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank"> (early footage)</a>
						 I think my most "developed" art skill is drawing (you can see my digital art <a href="https://www.artstation.com/greenrami" style="text-decoration: underline;"> here</a>). But I have knowledge and skills on all kinds of art including: animation, painting, sculpture, 3D modeling, and now, web design!
						Though it is now my dream to work as a UX designer on an awesome team, my secondary goal is to be an art teacher for children part time. I think art education is important, and from my experience 
						I don't think there is enough of it, and oftentimes programs that are designed to teach art can fail in certain areas. So I want to be a good example and hopefully the kids I teach will be better than me.
