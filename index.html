					<h2>About Me</h2>

					<p>Hello! My name is Ramie and I'm a recent graduate from UCI's Claire Trevor School of the
						Arts. Ever since I was a child I loved to make things, so it's only natural that I'd study art.
						I decided to become a UX designer because while I was studying I learned of the UX program
						at UCI and decided it would be a good fit for me. </p>

					<h2>Fun Facts</h2>
					<ul class="list_pos">
						<li> I was born on Pi day. (March 14th)</li>
						<li>I was an officer of the animation club at UCI.</li>
						<li>I like to draw and make video games in my spare time.</li>
