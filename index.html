		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hello! My name is Ramie and I'm a recent graduate from UCI's Claire Trevor School of the
			Arts. Ever since I was a child I loved to make things, so it's only natural that I'd study art.
			I decided to become a UX designer because while I was studying I learned of the UX program
			at UCI and decided it would be a good fit for me. </p>
